# Gravity Simulator
Hey there, [Gravity Simulator](https://utsavsingh899.github.io/Gravity-Simulator) is a website which simulates gravity in a system with multiple interacting objects(planets). If you find any bug/error or if you want to help me improve the site then feel free to contact me below. Constructive criticism is always welcomed and appreciated.
## Key Points:
* A website to simulate gravity and it's interaction with a system of objects(planets).
* The calculations are done using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
* Clicking adds an invisible mass that makes all other objects move towards it.
* Use the sliders to modify the simulation in the following ways:
  * Change the number of objects by using the first slider
  * Change the speed at which objects are rendered by using the second slider
  * Change the mass of objects by using the third slider
* Press any key to stop the simulation
## Technologies Used:
1. HTML/CSS
2. JavaScript
